"""
Simple program to fetch scraped data from the scrapinghub cloud storage.

Scraped pages are fetched one at a time from the cloud, cleaned and saved
as an individual json file. Name of the file is the hash code (generated
by python's inbuilt function). Files are saved individually in json folders
so that memory needs stay at a minimum during this and other operations.
Handling files in this way removes the limitation due to large combined
size of the file during this and analysis operations.
